        <p> Rabbits also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (which also contains the hares) of the order Lagomorpha (which also contains the pikas).
            <br> Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, 
            the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit.

            <p>
                Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new order, Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). 
                <br>Below are some of the genera and species of the rabbit.
