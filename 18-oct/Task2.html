                La Clue was attempting to evade Boscawen and bring the French Mediterranean Fleet into the Atlantic, avoiding battle if possible; he was then under orders to sail for the

                  Boscawen was under orders to prevent a French breakout into the Atlantic, and to pursue and fight the French if they did.

                The British caught up with the French on the 18th and fierce fighting ensued, during which several ships were badly damaged and one French ship was captured.
                The British, who greatly outnumbered the remaining six French ships, pursued them through the moonlit night of 18–19 August,
                during which a further two French ships made their escape. On the 19th the remnants of the French fleet attempted to shelter in
